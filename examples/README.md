# Cl Examples

This directory contains examples for using `cl`.

Examples are executable, so you can try them out and experiment with them. E.g.:

```
git clone https://github.com/svenfuchs/cl.git /tmp/cl
cd /tmp/cl
examples/gem
```

Examples are generated and verified by running:

```
bundle exec bin/examples
```

This command runs on [on Travis CI](https://github.com/svenfuchs/cl/blob/master/.travis.yml#L14)
in order to guarantee that all examples are up to date,
but also can be run in order to add or update examples.
